            <p className=" mt-3">Aurora began in 2018 where it was purchased from former Flamingo owners and renovated. The venue went under an extensive inside and out renovation which lasted approximately 3 years. With the help of expert interior designers, architects, and sound engineers we were able to create the perfect hall. Something that was versatile enough to change and make unique, but something which was composed of many details, whether it be physical decor or technological. We made sure to create something that exceeds the expectations of our most demanding customers, yet be extremely simple to plan events in.</p>
